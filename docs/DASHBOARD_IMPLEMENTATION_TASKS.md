# TRMS & SWIFT Dashboards - Implementation Tasks

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

Create two dedicated dashboard pages that provide real-time visibility into TRMS and SWIFT backend systems, allowing hackathon judges to see how AI agent interactions trigger immediate state changes across multiple financial systems.

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can see account balances update in real-time when AI books transactions
- SWIFT message status progression is visible as payments flow through the system
- EOD readiness status updates as AI resolves blocking issues
- All updates happen automatically via polling (no manual refresh needed)
- Demo-ready for side-by-side presentation (chat + dashboards)
