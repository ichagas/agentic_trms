  Key Integration Points

  TRMS ‚Üí SWIFT Workflow:
  1. bookTransaction() creates transaction in TRMS
  2. sendSwiftPayment() sends MT103 for that transaction
  3. reconcileSwiftMessages() matches SWIFT with TRMS
  4. getUnreconciledMessages() identifies issues

  EOD Processing:
  1. checkEODReadiness() verifies TRMS status
  2. proposeRateFixings() resolves missing market data
  3. getUnreconciledMessages() checks SWIFT reconciliation
  4. verifyEODReports() validates report files

  All functions are @Bean annotated and use @Description for Spring AI function calling, allowing the LLM to automatically invoke them based on user queries.

- Monitor logs: `./trms-services.sh logs ai-backend`

### Backup Demo Data

If live demo fails, show static screenshots and explain:
- System architecture and design decisions
- Code quality and Spring AI integration
- Ollama local LLM capabilities
- Extensibility for production use
