## 5. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hackathon Constraints

### 5.1 High-Priority Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **AI Integration Complexity** | High | Medium | Use Mock AI service first, then overlay real LLM |
| **Time Constraints** | High | High | Prioritize core demo flow, defer advanced features |
| **Integration Issues** | Medium | Medium | Establish API contracts early, use health checks |
| **Environment Setup** | Medium | Medium | Provide Docker Compose for consistent environments |
| **Demo Failures** | High | Low | Prepare fallback scenarios and recorded demos |

### 5.2 Technical Risk Management
- **Fallback AI Provider**: Always have Mock AI working as primary demo path
- **Simplified Data Models**: Use minimal viable data structures, expand later
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, add features incrementally
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test on multiple operating systems early
- **Network Resilience**: Implement proper timeout and retry mechanisms

### 5.3 Time Management Strategies
- **MVP Focus**: Implement minimum viable demo path first
- **Incremental Development**: Each component should be independently demoable
- **Parallel Workflows**: Maximize concurrent development opportunities
- **Feature Flags**: Use configuration to enable/disable advanced features
- **Demo-Driven Development**: Prioritize features that enhance demo impact
