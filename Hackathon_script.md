The Hackathon proposal is: 
 - Project: NextAgent Command Center (NACC) 
 - Description: Where Legacy Meets Intelligence: AI Agents That Speak Banking Fluently. Our goal is to simplify operations like checking EOD readiness or validating transactions which requires extensive manual effort and knowledge. We are going build AI agents to bridge this gap by understanding natural language requests and orchestrating multi-step operations across legacy systems, turning hours of manual work into simple conversations.

Let's work on the presentation script and review the scenarios.
I'm thinking about the main scenario to be about "Ready to run EOD". User will ask if both system are ready for EOD and will resolve the open issues using AI Chat bot help. 
We might have between 5 to 7 mins to present the demo:
  0:30 - Intro: main page (chat), TRMS and SWIFT dashboards
  0:30 - Simple inquiries, no real action for audience adaptation
  0:30 - Refresh page and starting script: Asking if EOD is ready ion both systems
  0:30 - Book a CASH transaction transfering cash from 2 accounts
  0:30 - Linking SWIFT transaction to resolve UNRECONCILED status (use previous transaction ID)
  0:30 - Another ask if EOD is ready
  0:30 - Resolve the TRMS missing resets
  0:30 - Resolve the SWIFT missing reports
  0:30 - Final ask if EOD is ready
  0:30 - SWIFT inquiry about the redemption report
  0:30 - TBD
  0:30 - TBD
  0:30 - TBD
  0:30 - TBD
  5:00 - Q&A and Discussion

Read docs/AI_FUNCTIONS_REFERENCE.md and DEMO_SCENARIOS.md to get more details about the scenarios and available functions.

The source code /Users/igorchagas/ideas/agentic_trms/backend/trms-ai-backend/src/main/java/com/trms/ai/service/TrmsAiService.java for the main AI agent orchestration logic.

1) Let's review all the flow
2) Make sure they are working properly and the type of inquiry need to input
3) Make adjustments in the frontend "tips" and "Try these queries", if need

For now, just analyze, review and propose any change before any code. I don't want to change anything that is not need.

what if we allow the llm make the decision which function to call instead of a rule-based aogorithm? How hard is to implement it as optional as paramenter? Standard is programatically and
